# CS290-400 Web Development | How-To Guide Assignment
## A cursory overview on making requests-to and handling responses-from the Wikipedia API  
### https://wolfelogic.github.io/index.html

To be 100% clear, this is an assignment from a student (read “not even remotely an expert”) on subject matter the student finds, to put it _nicely_, excruciatingly annoying (I mean, WTF hack is JSONP?! And what would we do w/o it?! (we’d probably have to send `CORS` specific headers that specify what URL to use… Or, just be cool about it and setting `access-control-origin` to `*` so it can be accessed by everyone and maybe handle access control some other way?)).  

Seriously though, this is more an exercise in futility than a _how-to-guide_… Follow it at your own risk (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
